This is a Yu-Gi-Oh! card game made in C++. That included designing and testing classes, implementing class templates, and utilizing data structures like stacks and queues for card decks and player hands. Players could create decks, add cards, and engage in battles. The game logic included handling life points, attack and defense mechanics, and determining the winner. Key skills demonstrated in this project included object-oriented programming, file I/O, and data management in C++.

# What I Learned in this Project
- Using C++ to design and test classes with implementations using class templates.
- Utilizing data structures like stacks and queues for card decks and player hands.
- Demonstrating knowledge in object-oriented programming, file I/O, and data management in C++ when dereferencing pointers.

# How to Set Up
This project was implemented on my macbook using:
- Xcode at the time. Any terminal with gcc installed will work
- Clone this repository 
- Open terminal at the codebase `~.../yu-gi-oh--c-/yugioh-codebase/`
- Run the `a.out` that is included or compile your own executable with
```zsh
g++ -o my_program main.cpp
```
- Then use `./a.out` or `./my_program` depending on whatever you named your executable.
